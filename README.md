# DATANGLE
**DATA for GENTANGLE**
___

## Overview

This repository contains example data for the [GENTANGLE](https://github.com/BiosecSFA/gentangle) (Gene Tuples ArraNGed in overLapping Elements) pipeline including its computational core [CAMEOX](https://github.com/BiosecSFA/cameox) (CAMEOs eXtended). 

The data in this repository could be used as an example to run the different entry points on the GENTANGLE Singularity container. Please visit the [GENTANGLE repository](https://github.com/BiosecSFA/gentangle) and [GENTANGLE wiki](https://github.com/BiosecSFA/gentangle/wiki) for further details and updated documentation.
